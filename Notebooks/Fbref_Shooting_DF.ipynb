    "Football reference is a website with comprehensive views of statistics for all football(soccer) teams and competitions. Statistics range from standard statistics to advanced stastics, for both offensive and defensive actions.   Expected Goals (xG) has emerged as a leading advanaced statistic to measure performance. xG is interpereted exactly how it sounds; how many goals a team would have been expected to score based on performance.  When a team that is winning games by significantly outperforming their xG, it may indicate that the team's form in unsustainable.  Conversely, a team that is dropping points while underperforming xG might just be having a stretch of bad luck.  So if a team is on a stretch of wins or losses, it could be worthwile to see if their results reflect what is expected based on performance.  "

    "Using FBRef, match logs for each team is accesible on the teams profile, and these logs can easily exported to CSV and Excel formats.  However, to get data for each team you would need to go to the team's profile and export manually.  The drawbacks being that 1) every time new data is loaded to the site the files would have to be manually extraced again and 2) there is not a dataset for all match logs from every team so we can easily compare xG trends across teams.  The result of this notebook is a dataset of all match logs for the Premier League 2020-2021 season.  Everytime the notebook is run it will use web scraping techniques to parse the URLs for the individual team matchlogs (regarding advanced shooting stats) then consolidate them into one copmrehensive dataset."
